title: restfuse - An open-source JUnit extension for automated HTTP/REST Tests
---
<p>
An open-source <a href="http://junit.org">JUnit</a> extension for automated HTTP/REST Tests. Everything you need to know to get started is displayed in the snippet below which is a fully functional HTTP Test.
By the way, restfuse also supports the <a href="asynchron">testing of asynchronous REST services</a>.

{% highlight java %}		 
@RunWith( HttpJUnitRunner.class )
public class RestfuseTest {

  @Rule
  public Destination destination = new Destination( "http://restfuse.com" ); 

  @Context
  private Response response;

  @HttpTest( method = Method.GET, path = "/" )
  public void checkRestfuseOnlineStatus() {
    assertOk( response );
  }  
}  
{% endhighlight %} 
</p>
<p>
This test sends a request to restfuse.com before the test method will be executed. After the request returns the response will be injected by assigning the <code>@Context</code> annotated <code>response</code> field before the test method will be executed. This field can be used within the test method to test the content of the response.
