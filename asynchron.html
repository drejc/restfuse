title: Testing asynchronous REST services
---
<p>
Regardless for what you are using an asynchronous mechanism you only have two options to deal with 
it, Polling or Callbacks. Both methods are supported by restfuse. 
</p>
<p>
When you need to poll an asynchronous service more than once you can use the <code>@Poll</code>
annotation. A simple example looks like the one below. The service in this example will be called 
5 times as the same as the test method. The response for each request will be injected into the 
test object and can be tested.

To use a callback to test an asynchronous service you can use the <code>@Callback</code> annotation
on you test method. Restfuse will start a server on the defined port and registers a resource. The 
test fails if the attached resource was not called. Within the resource you can test the incoming 
request. A simple callback example looks like this.
